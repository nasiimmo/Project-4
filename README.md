### Brief

Within a specified one-week timeframe, my aim was to conceive and craft a fully functional full-stack website, accompanied by a bespoke backend solution. This project was undertaken independently, with the objective of demonstrating proficiency in both front-end and back-end development disciplines.

### Project Requirements

- Full-Stack Development: Develop a complete application with both backend and front-end components.
- Backend with Django API: Create a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve data from a Postgres database.
- Front-end with React: Build a separate front-end using React to consume the API.
- CRUD Functionality: Implement CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models, demonstrating multiple relationships within the application.
- User Stories and Wireframes: Define and incorporate thoughtful user stories and wireframes to guide the development process, distinguishing core MVP features from secondary ones.
- Visual Design: Design visually impressive interfaces to elevate the portfolio and leave a lasting impression on clients and potential employers.
- Deployment: Deploy the application online to make it publicly accessible.

### Planning

On the first day, I brainstormed numerous ideas and settled on my passion for cars as the theme for my project. Following this, I carefully sketched out wireframes for each webpage. Subsequently, I chose the name "FastLaneFleet" for the project. Throughout this phase, I prioritized thorough planning, recognizing its importance in achieving project success.
